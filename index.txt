To initialise a repository locally
# git init

To check the status of the staging area
# git status

To remove a file from the stagin area i.e, stop it from being tracking
# git rm file_name or git rm -f file_name (this removes the file completely)
# git rm --cached file_name (this unstages it instead)

Making a commit
If this is your first commit, then you need to config your email and user name on your pc.
Run
    git config --global user.email "adamsfaisal2003@gmail.com"
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"

NOTE: To check for more information of different git commands...
Run
    git git_command --help

To commit with a message
# git commit -m "Initial commit"

To look at all of our previous commits
# git log
#git log --oneline

To switch between commits
# git checkout commit_id


To go back in time but git creates the revert as another commit. So you dont loose all your commits
#git revert commit_id

To go back in time and remain in that commit. Reset works in three different stages. it works in soft, mixed and hard.

#git reset commit_id

Creating a .gitignore
To add files
# put in the name of the file with the extension
# the "#" is seen as a comment
# then track the .gitignore file. run: git add .
# and commit also
# git rm -r --cached . (This removes all of the cached files)
# git add . and git commit
How to add directories in git
